# Prediction Market Analysis

A framework for analyzing prediction market data, including the largest publicly available dataset of Polymarket and Kalshi market and trade data. Provides tools for data collection, storage, and running analysis scripts that generate figures and statistics.

## Overview

This project enables research and analysis of prediction markets by providing:
- Pre-collected datasets from Polymarket and Kalshi
- Data collection indexers for gathering new data
- Analysis framework for generating figures and statistics

Currently supported features:
- Market metadata collection (Kalshi & Polymarket)
- Trade history collection via API and blockchain
- Parquet-based storage with automatic progress saving
- Extensible analysis script framework

## Installation & Usage

Requires Python 3.9+. Install dependencies with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):

```bash
uv sync
```

Download and extract the pre-collected dataset (36GiB compressed):

```bash
make setup
```

This downloads `data.tar.zst` from [Cloudflare R2 Storage](https://s3.jbecker.dev/data.tar.zst) and extracts it to `data/`.

### Data Collection

Collect market and trade data from prediction market APIs:

```bash
make index
```

This opens an interactive menu to select which indexer to run. Data is saved to `data/kalshi/` and `data/polymarket/` directories. Progress is saved automatically, so you can interrupt and resume collection.

### Running Analyses

```bash
make analyze
```

This opens an interactive menu to select which analysis to run. You can run all analyses or select a specific one. Output files (PNG, PDF, CSV, JSON) are saved to `output/`.

### Packaging Data

To compress the data directory for storage/distribution:

```bash
make package
```

This creates a zstd-compressed tar archive (`data.tar.zst`) and removes the `data/` directory.
