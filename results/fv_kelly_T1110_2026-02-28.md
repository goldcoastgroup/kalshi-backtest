# FV-Kelly — Temperature T=1.110 vs T=1.0

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Strategy:** `fv_kelly` (baseline config: `min_edge=0.17`, `kelly_fraction=0.5`, `max_position_fraction=0.25`)
**Feed:** `KalshiRTFeed`
**Change tested:** FV timeseries regenerated with temperature `T=1.110` (vs baseline `T=1.0`)

---

## Motivation

Temperature scaling controls how sharp the model's probability predictions are.
A higher T pushes predictions closer to 0.5 (softer), while T=1.0 uses raw model output.
T=1.110 was evaluated to see if a slightly softer calibration improves edge quality or
reduces drawdown.

## Conclusion: T=1.0 retained

T=1.110 is modestly worse across nearly every metric — lower return, lower Sharpe,
lower profit factor, lower win rate, and weaker statistical significance.

The only improvement is a meaningfully lower max drawdown (11.7% vs 13.3%).
T=1.110 produces more conservative FV estimates, which slightly tightens the edge filter
and reduces exposure to extreme bets.

The +7 additional fills suggest T=1.110 widens the FV-to-market gap on some markets,
triggering bets that T=1.0 would not. Those marginal bets are net-negative quality
(profit factor 3.98 vs 4.25).

**Decision: retain T=1.0.** The drawdown improvement does not justify the across-the-board
degradation in return, Sharpe, and statistical confidence.
